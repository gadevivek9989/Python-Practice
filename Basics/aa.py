x = 23

x +=1
print(x) #24

x -= 4
print(x) #20

x *= 5
print(x) #100 or u can use x = x*5

x //= 4
print(x)   #25 

x /= 5
print(x)  #5.0 note it gives float value if u use single slash

x **=2
print(x)  #25 note it it is the power on x

x %= 5
print(x) #0 in this case you do divide and the remainder is te answer

greeting = 'good'
greeting = greeting + 'morning'  # you can write in this way also greeting+= 'morning
print(greeting)

greeting = greeting *  5    #you can write in this way also greeting*= 5
print( greeting)
